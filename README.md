# E-commerce Order Analysis and Charges Calculation

This repository contains the code and documentation for the E-commerce Order Analysis and Charges Calculation project. The project focuses on analyzing e-commerce orders, calculating courier charges, and identifying discrepancies in the billing process.

## Project Overview

The project aims to analyze e-commerce order data and calculate courier charges based on various factors, such as order weight, delivery zones, and payment modes. It includes the following components:

- Data preprocessing and merging
- Calculation of charges for individual orders
- Analysis of overcharged and undercharged orders
- Generation of summary tables and results

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script `analysis_script.py` to perform data analysis and charge calculation.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains input data files (e.g., order data, courier rates).
- `output/`: Contains the generated output files (e.g., analysis results, summary tables).
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data analysis and charge calculation.

## Results

The analysis results, including discrepancies in charges, summary tables, and recommended actions, can be found in the `output/` directory.

## Documentation

- `Analysis_Documentation.md`: Detailed documentation explaining the analysis process, calculations, and methodologies.
- `Recommendations.md`: Recommendations for addressing discrepancies, improving accuracy, and enhancing the billing process.
